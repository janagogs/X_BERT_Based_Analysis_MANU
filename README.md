# Seasonal and Regional Variations in Air Pollution Awareness on X: A BERT-Based Analysis

Air pollution remains a long-standing environmental issue throughout the Balkan region, with PM10 concentrations frequently exceeding recommended limits, particularly during the winter heating season. In countries such as Macedonia, high pollution levels are largely attributed to residential heating, traffic emissions, and industrial activities. Although official air quality monitoring stations provide objective and reliable measurements, they fail to reflect how citizens perceive pollution and respond to pollution episodes in real time.

Social media platforms—especially X—offer a space where users openly share opinions, concerns, and personal experiences related to environmental conditions, producing large volumes of short and informal textual data. Consequently, data from X can serve as a valuable complementary source for assessing public awareness and sentiment toward air pollution. Recent developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transformer-based models, have significantly improved the analysis of short social media texts, enabling more robust and accurate examination of air pollution–related discourse.

This study builds upon our previous work by assessing the stability, consistency, and regional variability of social-media-based indicators of air pollution awareness across Macedonia and the broader Balkan region over a two-year period. Expanding the temporal scope of the dataset, we perform a more fine-grained analysis of seasonal trends, with a specific focus on contrasts between heating and non-heating periods. Furthermore, we compare the performance of RoBERTa-base-sentiment and BERTweet for sentiment classification and employ topic modeling to investigate whether previously identified relationships between PM10 concentrations and social media discussions persist across different regions and timeframes.
